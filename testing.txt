Testing for Adopt-a-Dog Seattle
HTML200-JavaScript & Responsive Design Course Project

I tested my site on the following devices and browsers:

Desktop/Laptop:
- Edge (Windows/macOS)
- Safari (Windows/macOS
- Brave (Windows/macOS)
- Chrome (Windows/macOS)

Mobile:
- Safari on iOS on iPhone Pro 12 (6.1" screen) and iPad Pro (10.5" screen)
- Edge on iOS on iPhone Pro 12 (6.1" screen) and iPad Pro (10.5" screen)

The target audience for this website is primarily adults over the age of 18 in Western WA State.

The form and function of my website was good on mobile. 
The site scaled well on both phones and tablets, and I didn't notice any browser-dependent issues.
The main problem I observed was aesthetic, and primarily in portrait mode, which is 
the typical screen orientation for mobile users. The header seemed to be cluttered,
with elements much to close to one another, albeit not overlapping. In the body of each
page, pictures, text, buttons, etc were all responsive and perofmre3d as expected.

As for desktop, my header issue was sort of the opposite--I felt the header
took up much more space than needed, even for devices that can afford the
screen-real estate. There was lots of unused space, and the elements were much smaller than I anticipated.
The checkout buttons and information that displays in the top right corner should probably be made bigger for desktop users.

The site is generally responsive and built using progressive enhancement. That said, it tested well on both
desktop and mobile devices. While the CSS for the site could use some adjustments, especially for both the header and footer,
for purposes of this assignment I'm leaving well enough alone.
